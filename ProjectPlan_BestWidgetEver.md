Folders:  
- firmware, holds firmware for BWE
- parts, holds specifications for all parts for PCB and enclosure etc.
- pcb, holds the schematic and PCB design files.
- assembly, holds the folders and files for assembly of the PCB and the BWE.
- testing, holds the test procedure and testing specifications for BWE.

## This project milestones
- Drawings for all parts in folders, electrical and mechanical 
- Update parts master to assign PartNumbers
- Schematic release V0.0.1 for initial review
- Review for manufacturing, testing, loading firmware, EMC, signal integerity, power distribution, safety, maximum temprature, ect...
- Update Schematic release V0.0.2 etc...
- Setup PCB software or train self for PCB manufacturing designe rules.

- Schematic approved for start of PCB layout V0.1.xx 
- Enclosure design review. (Make card board mockup, Cable mock up. PCB mockup.) 
- Enclosure design freeze for prototype PCB. PCB outline and connector placement freeze.
- PCB outline import parts and make and connector placement. Make mockup for fit to enclosure
- Milestone: PCB mechanical fit test, (PCB mockup with connector fits enclosure with cables etc...)
- Component placement for optimum routing and heat and Electromatnetic compatibility.  Then route.
- Review by fabricator of PCB against design rules.
