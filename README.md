# Best Widget Ever also known as: BWE
Best Widget Ever, a product development template.  
Idea for a template for documentation to help beginners when developing a project / product.

## Project plan for BWE

Folders: 
- HR, holds human resources information for the company which makes the BWE. Mix of public and private files.
- assembly, holds the folders and files for assembly of the PCB and the BWE.
- firmware, holds firmware for BWE
- legal, holds documents requiring legal skills for management. Corporate documents, patent related information for the company which makes the BWE. Mix of public and private files.
- marketing and sales, holds the marketing plans and history, Sales documents.  Mix of public and private files.
- parts, holds specifications for all parts for PCB and enclosure etc. This folder has subfolders and a simple "Parts Master" spread sheet.
- The subfolder, "pcb" holds the schematic and PCB design files and the files generated from them.
- testing, holds the product qualification test procedure and testing specifications and the factory test procedures for BWE.

## This project milestones
From start of design to first production.
- Product Functional Specification Released.
- Proof of concept, sketches, drawings, mock-ups, bread boards and wishful thinking.
- Schematics and drawings for all parts in folders, electrical and mechanical.
- Test points for manufacturing / troubleshooting especially for power.
- Update parts master to assign Part Numbers
- Schematic release V0.0.1 for initial review
- Review for manufacturing, testing, loading firmware, EMC, signal integrity, power distribution, safety, maximum temperature, etc...
- Update Schematic release V0.0.2 etc...
- Setup PCB software or train self for PCB manufacturing design rules.
- Schematic approved for start of PCB layout V0.1.xx Passes schematic design rules check.
- Assign and place PCB part number on PCB silk screen.
- Assign and place PCB version number on PCB silk screen.
- Place on the PCB silk screen a location for Serial Number to be applied at start of manufacture.
- Place on the PCB silk screen a logo.
- Place on the PCB silk screen a license or statement of copywrite.
- Enclosure design review. (Make card board mock up, Cable mock up. PCB mock up.) Make sure of clearance around all mounting hardware for screw / nut drivers.
- **Enclosure design freeze for prototype PCB. PCB outline and connector placement freeze.**
- PCB outline import parts and make and connector placement. Make mock up for fit to enclosure
- Milestone: PCB mechanical fit test, (PCB mock up with connector fits enclosure with cables etc...)
- Component placement for optimum routing and heat and Electromagnetic compatibility.  Then route.
- Connect through hole component traces to "teardrop" pads for strength. Route so that traces can be inspected (Not under connectors for example).
- PCB passes DRC (Design rules check).
- Review of Gerbers and other files by fabricator of PCB against design rules.
- Inventory and order parts including PCB and stencils.
- Make CAD files (STEP or other) of PCB and Enclosure and test fit in an assembly.  Reivew and specify any required changes.
- **Build Prototype** Enclosure and printed wirring assembly(s)
- Assemble first unit(s) and engineering and compliance (Safty, EMC, other) test.
- Engineering revise and release for rest of Prototype Run. Update of engineering, sales, legal documentation with photographs measurements of real hardware.
- Firmware code review and release.
- Factory Test in place.
- Changes and repeat all the above for Pilot Run (First selleable units with serial numbers etc).
