# Design Requirements for PWA (Printed Wiring Assembly) and Enclosure

## PWA Requirements
- Design for manufacturing
- Design for test
- Design for / with enclosure
- Design for development (test points, all nets accessible, in circuit programming and debug)
- Failure Modes Effects Analysis especially on miss plugged cables.


## Enclosure Requirements
- Material suitable for operating environment
- Water and dust resistant as required
- Design for manufacturing
- Minimal tools
- Tools that will not scratch finishes or hurt operator.
- Minimal operator skill
- Minimal diversity of fasteners
- Surfaces are not easily damaged during assembly
- Can be disassembled and reassembled
- Mold in user information and instructions
- Mold in compliance decelerations
- Proves location for model and serial number
- AC Line Power requires design for safety against shock and fire.
